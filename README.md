## Synopsis

It uses Google Maps Android API. It show ATM locations of more than 20 banks in city of Rijeka. When the bank is selected, application will get data from Parse core, parse it and show ATM locations to the user as pins. When you click on a pin its address is shown and a button to start navigation. Certain banks offer useful advice such as where you can withdraw money free of charge. You can also change terrain type in menu. Internet connection is required. Otherwise, alert will be displayed.

## Motivation
